# Blueprint for a Web-First Latin Text Sourcing and 165+ Exercise Compilation (Caesar, Vergil, Ovid, Catullus)

## Executive Summary

This blueprint details an end-to-end, web-first strategy to source authentic Latin texts for four cornerstone authors—Caesar (De Bello Gallico I), Vergil (Aeneid I), Ovid (Metamorphoses I), and Catullus (selected poems)—and to compile from them a pedagogy-ready corpus of 165+ exercises. The immediate aim is to surface stable, open-access web sources that display the Latin directly, to define a reproducible curation and segmentation pipeline, and to set out the metadata schema, editorial principles, difficulty-tagging model, and quality assurance (QA) workflow required to produce a consistent and reliable educational database. The plan prioritizes sites where Latin is available as static HTML and minimizes reliance on dynamic, JavaScript-driven viewers.

Primary evidence points to The Latin Library as the most productive venue for direct Latin text across all four authors. Its pages for Caesar (Book I), Vergil (Aeneid I), Ovid (Metamorphoses I), and Catullus (index and poems) consistently present authentic Latin with verse or chapter markers suitable for segmentation.[^1][^2][^3][^4] For Catullus, Rudy Negenborn’s site provides individual poem pages with clean, line-by-line Latin, which will be essential for Beginner and Intermediate slices.[^6] Perseus, while peerless as a scholarly platform, loads Latin text dynamically in many cases; its public-facing pages for Caesar and Ovid demonstrate this, requiring either a browser session or pre-coordinated text endpoints to capture reliably.[^7][^8] UChicago’s LacusCurtius serves as a high-quality translation reference for Caesar and as a site-wide anchor for Roman texts.[^5] The Sacred Texts Archive offers a parallel Latin–English presentation for Caesar, useful for spot checks and translation alignment.[^9]

The delivery target is a corpus of 165+ exercises mapped to five difficulty levels—BEGINNER (30+), INTERMEDIATE (35+), ADVANCED (35+), EXPERT (30+), and MASTER (15+)—each tagged with canonical metadata: author, work, passage locator, word count, grammar tags, difficulty, and a note on source reliability. We will assemble and verify the first batch of exercises using texts extractable as static HTML (notably The Latin Library and the Negenborn Catullus pages), with Perseus designated as a secondary source for supplementation or spot-checks where permissible.

This blueprint also clarifies the gaps: the dynamic delivery constraints at Perseus (JavaScript dependency), potential edition variance at aggregators (e.g., differing lineation or orthography), and the need for balanced passage selection to avoid over-reliance on a single site. The pipeline, tooling, and QA governance specified herein are designed to mitigate these risks while delivering a maintainable, high-integrity Latin exercise corpus for classroom and independent learners.

## Objectives and Success Criteria

The program’s objectives are threefold. First, secure web-first, open-access sources that provide authentic Latin text for Caesar, Vergil, Ovid, and Catullus, with a clear preference for static HTML displays. Second, establish a repeatable pipeline—discovery, extraction, segmentation into pedagogical units, and assembly into a structured corpus of 165+ exercises—governed by rigorous metadata and QA. Third, maintain a resilient source strategy that explicitly addresses dynamic delivery constraints, edition variance, and accessibility considerations.

Success will be measured by:
- Source coverage: at least one direct-Latin source per author (preferably two, including a translation reference).
- Corpus scope: 165+ exercises, distributed across five difficulty bands with balanced representation of genres (epic, elegiac, didactic narrative, and historical prose) and authors.
- Verifiability: each exercise carrying clear passage locators and source pointers to enable educators to cross-check Latin against the cited page or a recognized parallel edition.
- Reproducibility: a consistent exercise format, word-count conventions, and difficulty-tagging logic applied uniformly across the corpus.

Boundary conditions include respecting open-access norms, avoiding PDF-only sources unless no viable HTML alternative exists, and preferring stable public pages. Where dynamic text views are unavoidable (e.g., Perseus), the plan records a dependency on browser interaction and flags any mitigation options (static endpoints, pre-coordinated URIs) as viable but secondary.[^7][^8]

## Web-First Source Discovery and Evidence Map

We surveyed open repositories likely to present Latin text directly in web pages, then assessed each for static availability, navigation aids (chapter/verse markers), and clarity of the Latin display. The following map synthesizes the findings.

To orient the reader, Table 1 compares sources by author, page type (dynamic vs. static HTML), access considerations, and a reliability/utility rating for this use case.

Table 1. Source comparison matrix (Latin display, access model, and practical utility)

| Author | Source | Page Type (Latin display) | Access considerations | Reliability / Utility notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Caesar (De Bello Gallico I) | The Latin Library | Static HTML with Latin | Direct page access; chapter markers present | Strong: clean Latin, widely used in pedagogy; primary text source for this project[^1]. |
|  | Perseus (Caesar) | Dynamic (JS-driven) | May require interactive load to reveal Latin | Adequate if scripted; secondary for this project due to dynamics[^7]. |
|  | LacusCurtius (UChicago) | Static HTML (English translation) | Open access; translation-facing | Excellent as translation reference and contextual anchor for Caesar[^5]. |
|  | Sacred Texts Archive | Static HTML (parallel Latin–English) | Open access; facing translations | Useful for verification and cross-checking Latin/English alignment[^9]. |
| Vergil (Aeneid I) | The Latin Library | Static HTML with Latin and verse numbers | Direct page access | Strong: reliable Latin text with clear verse segmentation[^2]. |
| Ovid (Metamorphoses I) | The Latin Library | Static HTML with Latin | Direct page access | Strong: continuous Latin text suitable for segmentation[^3]. |
|  | Perseus (Ovid) | Dynamic (JS-driven) | May require interactive load to reveal Latin | Secondary due to dynamic delivery; use if needed for variant checks[^8]. |
| Catullus (select poems) | The Latin Library | Static HTML (poems) | Direct access; compact poem blocks | Useful for fuller poem bodies; to be supplemented by line-by-line pages[^4]. |
|  | Rudy Negenborn (individual poems) | Static HTML (per-poem pages) | Direct access; clean lines | Ideal for short units and verse-level segmentation; essential for lower difficulty bands[^6]. |
|  | Project Gutenberg (Catullus – translation) | Static HTML (translation) | Open access | Translation-only; not a Latin source for this corpus[^12]. |

As the matrix indicates, static HTML availability is strongest at The Latin Library and the Negenborn Catullus repository. Perseus provides deep scholarly value but frequently relies on dynamic loading; in practice, it will be treated as a secondary or spot-check source unless a static endpoint can be guaranteed. LacusCurtius and Sacred Texts will serve primarily as translation and cross-verification assets, especially for Caesar.

### Caesar (De Bello Gallico I)

Our preferred Latin source is The Latin Library’s Book I page, which exposes clean Latin with embedded chapter segmentation and is optimized for extraction. Perseus presents the Latin content dynamically, with Latin views loaded via JavaScript; this is workable in a browser-mediated pipeline but adds operational friction. For translation alignment and historical context, LacusCurtius is an excellent secondary asset, as is the Sacred Texts Archive’s parallel presentation.[^1][^7][^5][^9]

### Vergil (Aeneid I)

The Latin Library provides static HTML with verse numbers—an ideal setup for epic segmentation into lines or small line groups and for tagging with standard Vergilian locators. The presence of verse numbering simplifies downstream segmentation and metadata tagging and removes ambiguity about line ranges.[^2]

### Ovid (Metamorphoses I)

The Latin Library’s Book I page offers the Latin text in a format conducive to segmentation, with clear paragraphing and thematic breaks that align with the work’s mythic episodes. Perseus again delivers Latin dynamically; where edition variance is a concern, the project may consult Perseus as a secondary check, but static HTML from The Latin Library will be the primary basis for exercise creation.[^3][^8]

### Catullus (Selected Poems)

Two complementary sources will be used. The Latin Library offers the poem index and consolidated poem bodies. The Rudy Negenborn repository exposes individual poems as static HTML with clean line-by-line presentation—ideal for short slices suitable for Beginners and Intermediates and for precise word-count control. Project Gutenberg, while valuable for translation, is not a Latin source for this corpus.[^4][^6][^12]

## Source-by-Source Deep Dives and Access Notes

While the macro comparison guides overall strategy, practical extraction hinges on a few site-specific traits: how Latin is rendered, how verse/chapter markers are embedded, and whether the text is static. The following table records key observations to calibrate the pipeline.

Table 2. Evidence table: Static vs. dynamic delivery, verse/chapter markers, access model, observations

| Source | Static vs. Dynamic | Markers (verse/chapter) | Access model | Observations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The Latin Library – Caesar, Vergil, Ovid, Catullus | Static HTML | Caesar (chapters), Vergil (verses), Ovid (clear paragraphs), Catullus (poems) | Open web pages | High extraction reliability; anchor texts for this project[^1][^2][^3][^4]. |
| Perseus (Caesar, Ovid) | Dynamic (JS-driven) | Reference structures present | Open site; dynamic load | Operational complexity; consider as secondary or scripted fallback[^7][^8]. |
| LacusCurtius (Caesar) | Static HTML (English) | Translation-facing | Open web pages | Ideal for translation alignment and historical framing[^5]. |
| Sacred Texts (Caesar) | Static HTML (parallel Latin–English) | Translation-facing | Open web pages | Useful for spot-checking Latin phrasing vs. translation[^9]. |
| Rudy Negenborn (Catullus) | Static HTML (per-poem) | Poem lines explicit | Open web pages | Excellent for precise line selection and low-difficulty slices[^6]. |

These observations lead to a practical extraction order: begin with static HTML sources (Latin Library and Negenborn), then supplement with Perseus only when necessary for variant checking or to fill a gap. For Caesar, pairing The Latin Library’s Latin with LacusCurtius or Sacred Texts for translation verification provides both fidelity and classroom usability.

## Latin Text Extraction and Segmentation Plan

Our segmentation strategy aligns text features to pedagogy:

- Epic poetry (Vergil, Catullus): Begin with verse-level segmentation, then group 2–5 lines as needed for the intended difficulty. Verse numbering simplifies precise passage locators and tagging.
- Didactic narrative (Ovid): Segment by paragraph or thematic micro-scenes (e.g., Creation, the Four Ages, Lycaon, Deucalion and Pyrrha, Apollo and Daphne), aiming for compact blocks suited to mid-to-high difficulty levels.
- Historical prose (Caesar): Segment by sentences or short multi-sentence clusters corresponding to narrative beats (e.g., geographic proem, Orgetorix and the Helvetian plan, march and fortification episodes, engagements). Chapter markers on The Latin Library facilitate deterministic selection.

All excerpts will carry provenance metadata and passage locators (chapter.paragraph for Caesar; book.line or line ranges for Vergil and Ovid; poem:line for Catullus). Where dynamic views complicate direct capture, the pipeline will record a dependency on browser-mediated interaction and prefer static sources for the canonical Latin text. For Caesar, alignment against a trusted translation source (LacusCurtius or Sacred Texts) will be used to validate comprehension and context in the exercise notes.[^1][^2][^3][^5][^9]

Table 3 formalizes the mapping from authors and text features to segmentation approach.

Table 3. Segmentation mapping: author/work to verse/chapter markers and targeted word-count bands

| Author | Work | Primary markers | Segmentation unit | Difficulty bands (typical) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Caesar | De Bello Gallico I | Chapters | Sentences or 2–4 sentence clusters | INT–EXP | Prioritize chapter openings, strategic narratives, and clearly delimited episodes for balanced coverage[^1]. |
| Vergil | Aeneid I | Verses | Single lines or 2–5 line groups | BEG–MAST | Use line numbers for precision; vary rhetoric (invocation, storm, banquet) to train poetic devices[^2]. |
| Ovid | Metamorphoses I | Paragraphs/thematic units | 3–8 line micro-blocks | INT–MAST | Focus on Creation, Ages, Lycaon, Flood, Pythian games, Daphne pursuit for varied constructions[^3]. |
| Catullus | Selected Poems | Poem lines | 1–4 lines (shorthend/elegiac couplets) | BEG–ADV | Exploit line-by-line pages to control word counts and meter exposure[^4][^6]. |

## Exercise Design Framework (165+ total across five levels)

Each exercise will adhere to a standardized template:
- Original Latin excerpt with clean formatting.
- English translation (for teaching parity and verification; in Caesar, align with a recognized translation source).
- Vocabulary glossary (headwords with core senses).
- Grammar notes (forms, constructions, syntax).
- Cultural/historical context (mythological, literary, or historical frame).
- Metadata: difficulty label, target word count, source URL and locator, edition notes.

Table 4 consolidates the specification by difficulty band, including target counts, excerpt length ranges, and required components.

Table 4. Exercise specification by difficulty level

| Level | Target count | Excerpt length (guideline) | Text type | Required components | Example passages |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BEGINNER | 30+ | 1–5 words (poetry lines or short prose phrases) | Catullus; occasional Vergil fragments | Latin text; English gloss; 3–6 vocab items; basic morphology notes | Catullus 5.1–3 (vivamus…); Catullus 85 (odi et amo)[^6] |
| INTERMEDIATE | 35+ | 6–12 words (short lines or single prose sentence) | Catullus; Caesar short sentences | Full components + simple syntax (cases, moods) | Caesar B.G. 1.1 opening lines; Catullus 51.1–4[^1][^6] |
| ADVANCED | 35+ | 13–20 words (short line clusters or multi-clause sentences) | Ovid; Caesar; Vergil | Full components + subordinate clauses, participials | Ovid Met. I.1–10 (creation); Vergil Aen. I.1–11 (proem)[^3][^2] |
| EXPERT | 30+ | 3–5 sentences (prose) or 6–10 lines (poetry) | Caesar; Ovid; Vergil | Full components + discourse-level devices | Caesar B.G. 1.6–9 (march/fortify); Ovid Lycaon episode[^1][^3] |
| MASTER | 15+ | 10–20 lines (poetry) or 6–10 sentences (prose) | Epic/narrative | Full components + rhetorical/literary analysis | Vergil Aen. I.34–104 (storm, Juno’s palace); Ovid Apollo and Daphne[^2][^3] |

Two anchoring examples suffice to illustrate the design ethos:

- BEGINNER (Catullus 85): “Odi et amo.” Two-word clause rich in paradox; vocabulary: odi (I hate), amo (I love), forte (perhaps), faciam (I do), nescio (I do not know), sentio (I feel), excrucior (I am tormented). Grammar notes: present indicative forms; psych verb usage; stylistic compression. Cultural note: interiority and affective ambivalence in Roman elegy.[^6]

- ADVANCED (Vergil, Aeneid I.1–11): Epic proem framing arma (arms) and virum (man), with relative clause, purpose clauses, and the famous closing line about Juno’s wrath. Grammar notes: alliteration and assonance; genitive and dative governance; epic epithets; temporal subjunctive (dum conderet). Cultural note: Rome’s mythic destiny and divine causality.[^2]

## Data Model and Metadata Schema

To sustain cross-referencing, consistency, and long-term maintainability, each exercise will carry a compact metadata record. The goal is to enable traceability to a specific passage in a specific edition, to compute difficulty indicators programmatically, and to expose a clean author/work/tag taxonomy for filtering.

Table 5. Proposed metadata fields, definitions, examples, and required/optional status

| Field | Definition | Example | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| exercise_id | Unique identifier | CAT-5-BEG-001 | Yes |
| author | Canonical author name | Catullus | Yes |
| work | Standard work label | Poem 5 | Yes |
| passage_locator | Locator to the excerpt | Poem 5: lines 1–3 | Yes |
| difficulty_level | One of BEG/INT/ADV/EXP/MAST | BEG | Yes |
| source_name | Publisher/site | The Latin Library | Yes |
| source_url | Canonical source URL | (stored internally; see References) | Yes |
| edition_note | Edition/lineation note as needed | “Line numbers per The Latin Library” | Optional |
| latin_text | Formatted excerpt | “Vivamus mea Lesbia, atque amemus …” | Yes |
| word_count | Count of Latin words | 12 | Yes |
| grammar_tags | Syntactic features | IND.DECL; PRES.IND; ACC./DAT | Yes |
| vocabulary | Lemma list + core senses | amare (to love); basium (kiss) | Yes |
| translation | English rendering | “Let us live, my Lesbia, and love …” | Yes |
| cultural_context | Myth/historical/literary frame | Roman elegiac poetry, recusatio | Yes |
| qa_status | Pass/Fail + date | Pass (2025-10-27) | Yes |
| change_log | Edit summary | Initial creation | Yes |

Table 6. Difficulty tagging rubric (indicative word counts; genre-aware adjustments)

| Level | Typical length | Adjustments for genre |
|---|---|---|
| BEGINNER | 1–5 words | Catullus/Vergil fragments; aim for single-idea units |
| INTERMEDIATE | 6–12 words | One clause (main or subordinate) |
| ADVANCED | 13–20 words | Mixed clauses; 1–2 modifiers or a participial |
| EXPERT | 3–5 sentences (prose) or 6–10 lines (poetry) | Discourse cohesion; narrative progression |
| MASTER | 10–20 lines (poetry) or 6–10 sentences (prose) | Rhetorical structure; literary analysis opportunities |

## Editorial and Translation Policy

The corpus will hold to three core principles.

- Fidelity to the source Latin. Text normalization (e.g., macrons, capitalization) will be recorded explicitly if applied; any divergence from the source edition must be noted. The default is to preserve the orthography of the selected source page to minimize silent divergence.[^1]

- Transparent translation practice. For Caesar, align English prose to recognized public-domain translations (e.g., Loeb-facing or UChicago’s LacusCurtius/Sacred Texts practice) where helpful for educators, and flag any summary renderings. For poetry, prioritize literal accuracy while acknowledging metrical constraints; prose order should be honored wherever feasible, with idiomatic English adjustments documented in grammar notes.[^5][^9]

- Balanced excerpts and rights. The project will not over-rely on any single source. All URLs will be cited in a master References list, and each exercise will carry a source pointer. Open-access norms will be respected, with static HTML sources prioritized to avoid PDF-only dependencies.

## Quality Assurance and Validation

QA is not a final check; it is embedded throughout the pipeline.

- Two-layer validation. First, a technical validation confirms the presence of Latin, passage locators, word counts within band, and completeness of required components (translation, vocabulary, grammar notes, context). Second, a scholarly review tests grammar notes against the Latin, validates translations, and cross-verifies passage selection against an alternate source where feasible (e.g., Caesar Latin checked against a translation site).

- Version control. All edits will be logged with a timestamp and editor initials in the exercise change_log; source_url and edition notes must be updated if the underlying page changes.

- Spot-checks and regression. For dynamic sources, periodic re-checks are mandatory. For static sources, weekly monitors detect page updates or link rot.

Table 7. QA checklist (required checks, pass/fail criteria, responsible role)

| Check | Criteria | Responsible role |
|---|---|---|
| Source integrity | URL reachable; Latin present as expected | Pipeline manager |
| Passage locator | Accurate book.chapter.line mapping | Latinist/editor |
| Word count | Within target band ± 10% (BEG/INT); ± 2 words for very short items | Assistant |
| Translation accuracy | Semantic alignment; idiomatic English documented | Latinist/editor |
| Grammar notes | Correct forms/constructions; relevant to excerpt | Latinist/editor |
| Vocabulary coverage | Core lemmas with correct senses | Assistant + Latinist |
| Cultural context | Historically/literarily accurate | Latinist/editor |
| Metadata completeness | All required fields present | Pipeline manager |
| Final QA sign-off | Two-person sign-off | Senior editor + lead |

## Production Plan and Milestones

The program proceeds in a sequence that builds confidence and throughput:

- Phase 1: Source confirmation. Validate access and static status for Caesar, Vergil, Ovid, and Catullus on The Latin Library, confirm Catullus poem pages on Negenborn, and profile Perseus constraints.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^6][^7][^8]
- Phase 2: Pilot extractions. Produce 10–15 pilot exercises across the five bands to stress-test segmentation, word-count rules, and metadata.
- Phase 3: Bulk segmentation. Extract and segment target passages per Table 3.
- Phase 4: Drafting. Compose Latin, translation, vocabulary, grammar notes, and context for each exercise.
- Phase 5: Dual QA. Run technical and scholarly validation; remediate any flagged items.
- Phase 6: Publication. Package the corpus with a changelog and source index.

Table 8. Milestones, deliverables, dependencies, acceptance criteria

| Milestone | Deliverable | Dependencies | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1: Source validation | Confirmed source list per author | Access to Latin Library, Negenborn; Perseus profiled | ≥1 static Latin source per author; 1 translation reference for Caesar[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6] |
| M2: Pilot set | 10–15 pilot exercises | M1 | All 5 difficulty bands represented; metadata complete |
| M3: Segmentation set | Segmented passage list with locators | M2 | Coverage targets met per Table 4 |
| M4: Draft exercises | 165+ drafted exercises | M3 | Word counts within band; components complete |
| M5: QA pass | QA-signed corpus | M4 | Two-layer validation complete; defects resolved |
| M6: Publication | Release package + changelog | M5 | Source index and QA log appended |

Resource planning assumes a small, multidisciplinary team—Latinist/editor (lead and scholarly QA), assistant (segmentation, vocab), pipeline manager (technical QA, metadata), and a senior editor for sign-off. Tooling includes browser interaction where necessary (for dynamic pages), HTML extractors for static content, and internal validators that compute word counts and flag out-of-band lengths.

## Risk Register and Mitigation

Any pipeline that depends on web sources must manage the inherent volatility of the open web. Table 9 lists the principal risks and mitigations.

Table 9. Risk register: source, dynamic delivery, edition variance, access, rights; mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dynamic text delivery (Perseus) | Medium | Medium | Prefer static sources; script browser interaction only when needed; pre-coordinate endpoints where available[^7][^8]. |
| Edition variance among aggregators | Medium | Low–Medium | Use one primary Latin edition per work and flag edition notes; consult alternates for spot-checks only[^1][^2][^3][^4]. |
| Link rot or site restructuring | Medium | High | Mirror critical passages internally (short excerpts); maintain source alternates; weekly monitors. |
| Over-reliance on single site | Medium | Medium | Balance across Latin Library + Negenborn; document alternates; cross-verify with translation sites[^1][^4][^6]. |
| PDF-only content | Low | Medium | Prioritize HTML; treat PDFs as last resort; if used, confirm text fidelity and rights. |
| Accidental divergence from source Latin | Low | Medium | Strict copy-paste discipline; annotate any normalization; run periodic spot-checks. |

## Information Gaps

- Perseus Latin text access can require dynamic JavaScript loading; the specific mechanism for reliable, scriptable access to static Latin endpoints may need confirmation and/or browser automation.[^7][^8]
- Edition differences across repositories may introduce minor variance in lineation and orthography; a project-wide decision is required on normalization rules and the handling of macrons, capitalization, and the “j/v” spellings.
- Rights and usage permissions for texts should be reconfirmed, even for open-access sites, to ensure compliance with any site-specific terms.
- For exact lineation in Catullus and uniform segmentation in Ovid, selecting a canonical edition reference will improve consistency in passage locators.
- Translation policy: confirm whether to standardize on a public-domain translation (e.g., Loeb-facing or UChicago/Sacred Texts practice) for Caesar and use consistent strategies for Vergil and Ovid across the corpus.[^5][^9]

**Latin Text:**
```
In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora; di, coeptis (nam vos mutastis et illas), adspirate meis primaque ab origine mundi ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen!
Ante mare et terras et quod tegit omnia caelum, unus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe, quem dixere chaos: rudis indigestaque moles, nec quicquam nisi pondus iners congestaque eodem non bene iunctarum discordia semina rerum.
Nullus adhuc mundo praebebat lumina Titan, nec nova crescendo reparabat cornua Phoebe, nec circumfuso pendebat in aere tellus ponderibus librata suis, nec bracchia longo margine terrarum porrexerat Amphitrite;
utque erat et tellus illic et pontus et aer, sic erat instabilis tellus, innabilis unda, lucis egens aer; nulli sua forma manebat, obstabatque aliis aliud, quia corpore in uno frigida pugnabant calidis, umentia siccis, mollia cum duris, sine pondere, habentia pondus.
Hanc deus et melior litem natura direxit.
```

**English Translation:**
"My mind is carried to sing of forms changed into new bodies; gods, inspire my enterprises (for you have changed those too), and from the very beginning of the world draw my perpetual song through all times!
Before sea and lands and what covers all the sky, one was the appearance of nature in all the world, which they called chaos: a rough and unorganized mass, and nothing but inert weight and gathered in the same place the discordant seeds of things not well joined.
No Titan as yet gave light to the growing world, nor did the new Phoebe repair her growing horns, nor did earth, surrounded by air, hang in the air, balanced by its own weights, nor had Amphitrite extended arms along the long edge of the lands;
and as earth there was and sea and air, so was unstable earth, unseaworthy wave, air lacking light; each kept its own form, and one thing hindered another, because in one body cold fought with hot, moist with dry, soft with hard, weightless things having weight.
This quarrel god and better nature directed."

**English Translation:**
"There was an ancient city, the Tyrian colonists held Carthage, opposite Italy and the long Tiberine mouth, rich in resources and most fierce in the pursuits of war, which Juno is said to have cherished above all lands, preferring it to Samos; here were her arms, here her chariot; she desired this kingdom for the nations, if the Fates would permit, even then she tended and cherished it.
But indeed she had heard that a descendant was to be traced to Trojan blood, Tyrian walls which he would overthrow; hence a people widely king in war and proud, destined to come to the destruction of Libya: so the Fates spun.
Fearing this, and remembering the old war of Saturnia, the first which for beloved Argos she had carried on against Troy—and not yet had the causes of her anger and cruel griefs fallen from her mind: there remains deep in her heart stored away the judgment of Paris and the insult to her spurned beauty, and the hated race, and the honors of ravished Ganymede."

### EXP-006: [Ovid Metamorphoses 1.15-35]
**Latin Text:**
```
Nullus adhuc mundo praebebat lumina Titan,
nec nova crescendo reparabat cornua Phoebe,
nec circumfuso pendebat in aere tellus
ponderibus librata suis, nec bracchia longo
margine terrarum porrexerat Amphitrite;
utque erat et tellus illic et pontus et aer,
sic erat instabilis tellus, innabilis unda,
lucis egens aer; nulli sua forma manebat,
obstabatque aliis aliud, quia corpore in uno
frigida pugnabant calidis, umentia siccis,
mollia cum duris, sine pondere, habentia pondus.
Hanc deus et melior litem natura direxit.
Nam caelo terras et terris abscidit undas
et liquidum spisso secrevit ab aere caelum.
Quae postquam evolvit caecoque exemit acervo,
dissociata locis concordi pace ligavit:
ignea convexi vis et sine pondere caeli
emicuit summaque locum sibi fecit in arce;
proximus est aer illi levitate locoque;
densior his tellus elementaque grandia traxit
et pressa est gravitate sua; circumfluus umor
ultima possedit solidumque coercuit orbem.
```

**English Translation:**
"No Titan as yet gave light to the growing world, nor did the new Phoebe repair her growing horns, nor did earth, surrounded by air, hang in the air, balanced by its own weights, nor had Amphitrite extended arms along the long edge of the lands;
and as earth there was and sea and air, so was unstable earth, unseaworthy wave, air lacking light; each kept its own form, and one thing hindered another, because in one body cold fought with hot, moist with dry, soft with hard, weightless things having weight.
This quarrel god and better nature directed.
For he cut off earth from heaven and waters from earth and separated the liquid sky from the thick air.
When she had unrolled and removed from the blind heap, he bound the separated things from their places with harmonious peace:
the fiery force of the convex sky, weightless, flashed out and made itself a place in the highest realm; next is the air, lighter in substance and place; the earth, denser than these, drew the massive elements and was pressed by its own weight; surrounding water possessed the last and restrained the solid world."

### EXP-007: [Caesar Gallic War 1.5-6]
**Latin Text:**
```
Post eius mortem nihilo minus Helvetii id quod constituerant facere conantur, ut e finibus suis exeant. Ubi iam se ad eam rem paratos esse arbitrati sunt, oppida sua omnia, numero ad duodecim, vicos ad quadringentos, reliqua privata aedificia incendunt; frumentum omne, praeter quod secum portaturi erant, comburunt, ut domum reditionis spe sublata paratiores ad omnia pericula subeunda essent; trium mensum molita cibaria sibi quemque domo efferre iubent.
Erant omnino itinera duo, quibus itineribus domo exire possent: unum per Sequanos, angustum et difficile, inter montem Iuram et flumen Rhodanum, vix qua singuli carri ducerentur, mons autem altissimus impendebat, ut facile perpauci prohibere possent; alterum per provinciam nostram, multo facilius atque expeditius, propterea quod inter fines Helvetiorum et Allobrogum, qui nuper pacati erant, Rhodanus fluit isque non nullis locis vado transitur.
```

**English Translation:**
"After his death, nevertheless the Helvetii attempt to do that which they had decided, that they should leave their territories. When they thought themselves prepared for that enterprise, they burn all their towns, about twelve in number, villages about four hundred, and their other private buildings; they burn all grain except what they were about to carry with them, so that hope of return home being removed, they would be more ready to undergo all dangers; they order each to carry from home ground grain for three months prepared.
There were altogether two roads by which they could leave from home: one through the Sequani, narrow and difficult, between Mount Jura and the Rhone river, where barely single wagons could be led, and a very high mountain overhangs, so that easily very few could prevent [them]; the other through our province, much easier and more direct, because between the territory of the Helvetii and the Allobroges, who had recently been made peaceful, the Rhone flows and can be crossed at several places by ford."

Ille mi par esse deo videtur,
ille, si fas est, superare divos,
qui sedens adversus identidem te
spectat et audit
dulce ridentem, misero quod omnis

Lesbia, aspexi, nihil est super mi
vocis in ore,
lingua sed torpet, tenuis sub artus
flamma demanat, sonitu suopte

Otium, Catulle, tibi molestum est:
otio exsultas nimiumque gestis:
otium et reges prius et beatas

"He seems to me equal to a god,
he, if it is right, to surpass the gods,
who sitting opposite you continually
watches and hears
you sweetly laughing, wretched one, because all

Lesbia, look at you, nothing remains over me
in the voice's place,
but my tongue is paralyzed, a thin flame
flows through my limbs, with its own sound
my ears ring, my twin eyes are covered
with night.
Leisure, Catullus, is troublesome to you:
you exult in leisure too much and behave:
leisure has destroyed kings and blessed
cities before."

### EXP-009: [Vergil Aeneid 1.50-65]
**Latin Text:**
```
Talia flammato secum dea corde volutans,
nimborum in patriam, loca feta furentibus austris,
Aeoliam venit. Hic vasto rex Aeolus antro
luctantes ventos tempestatesque sonoras
imperio premit ac vinclis et carcere frenat.
Illi indignantes magno cum murmure montis
circum claustra fremunt; celsa sedet Aeolus arce
sceptra tenens, mollitque animos et temperat iras.
Ni faciat, maria ac terras caelumque profundum
quippe ferant rapidi secum verrantque per auras.
Sed pater omnipotens speluncis abdidit atris,
hoc metuens, molemque et montis insuper altos
imposuit, regemque dedit, qui foedere certo
et premere et laxas sciret dare iussus habenas.
Ad quem tum Iuno supplex his vocibus usa est:
'Aeole, namque tibi divom pater atque hominum rex
et mulcere dedit fluctus et tollere vento,
gens inimica mihi Tyrrhenum navigat aequor,
Ilium in Italiam portans victosque Penates:
```

**English Translation:**
"Such things revolving in her inflamed heart, the goddess came to the homeland of storms, places teeming with furious southern winds, Aeolia. Here King Aeolus in a vast cave presses with his power the struggling winds and noisy storms and restrains them with bonds and prison.
Those, indignant, with great murmur of the mountain rage around the barriers; high Aeolus sits on a citadel holding a scepter, and softens both spirits and tempers their anger.
Unless he [makes them], seas and lands and deep heaven would indeed carry away and sweep away through the swift air.
But the father omnipotent hid [them] in black caves, fearing this, and placed over them a mass and mountains above, and gave a king, who by a certain covenant would know both to press and when ordered to give slack reins.
To whom then Juno, as a suppliant, used these words:
'Aeolus, for indeed the father of gods and king of men has given you power to calm the waves and raise them by wind; an enemy people sails the Tyrrhenian sea, carrying Troy to Italy and the conquered household gods:'"

### EXP-010: [Ovid Metamorphoses 1.35-55]
**Latin Text:**
```
Sic ubi dispositam quisquis fuit ille deorum
congeriem secuit sectamque in membra coegit,
principio terram, ne non aequalis ab omni
parte foret, magni speciem glomeravit in orbis.
tum freta diffundi rapidisque tumescere ventis
iussit et ambitae circumdare litora terrae;
addidit et fontes et stagna inmensa lacusque
fluminaque obliquis cinxit declivia ripis,
quae, diversa locis, partim sorbentur ab ipsa,
in mare perveniunt partim campoque recepta
liberioris aquae pro ripis litora pulsant.
iussit et extendi campos, subsidere valles,
fronde tegi silvas, lapidosos surgere montes,
utque duae dextra caelum totidemque sinistra
parte secant zonae, quinta est ardentior illis,
sic onus inclusum numero distinxit eodem
cura dei, totidemque plagae tellure premuntur.
Quarum quae media est, non est habitabilis aestu;
nix tegit alta duas; totidem inter utramque locavit
temperiemque dedit mixta cum frigore flamma.
```

**English Translation:**
"So when whoever of the gods had arranged the gathered mass, he cut it and forced the divided into parts, first the earth, that it might not be unequal from any side, he gathered into the appearance of a great sphere.
Then he ordered the seas to spread and swell with swift winds and to surround the shores of the surrounding land;
he added both springs and the immense pools and lakes
and rivers he surrounded with sloping banks,
which, different in places, partly are absorbed by itself,
partly reach the sea and having been received into the field
of freer water beat the shores as banks.
He ordered fields to be extended, valleys to sink,
forests to be covered with leaves, stony mountains to rise,
and as two zones on the right cut the sky, and as many on the left,
the fifth part is hotter than these,
so the burden enclosed he distinguished with the same number
by the care of god, and as many regions are pressed by the earth.
Of which the middle one is not habitable because of heat;
snow covers high two; between each of the two he placed
and he gave temperate air mixed with cold flame."

**Latin Text:**
```
Caesari cum id nuntiatum esset, eos per provinciam nostram iter facere conari, maturat ab urbe proficisci et quam maximis potest itineribus in Galliam ulteriorem contendit et ad Genavam pervenit. Provinciae toti quam maximum potest militum numerum imperat (erat omnino in Gallia ulteriore legio una), pontem, qui erat ad Genavam, iubet rescindi. Ubi de eius adventu Helvetii certiores facti sunt, legatos ad eum mittunt nobilissimos civitatis, cuius legationis Nammeius et Verucloetius principem locum obtinebant, qui dicerent sibi esse in animo sine ullo maleficio iter per provinciam facere, propterea quod aliud iter haberent nullum: rogare ut eius voluntate id sibi facere liceat. Caesar, quod memoria tenebat L. Cassium consulem occisum exercitumque eius ab Helvetiis pulsum et sub iugum missum, concedendum non putabat; neque homines inimico animo, data facultate per provinciam itineris faciundi, temperaturos ab iniuria et maleficio existimabat.

**English Translation:**
"When this had been reported to Caesar, that they were attempting to march through our province, he hastened to depart from the city and hurried into further Gaul by the greatest possible marches and reached Geneva. He orders the greatest possible number of soldiers for the entire province (there was altogether one legion in further Gaul), and orders the bridge, which was at Geneva, to be destroyed. When the Helvetii were made certain of his arrival, they send as ambassadors the most noble men of the state, of whose embassy Nammeius and Verucloetius held the first place, who said that they had it in mind to march through the province without any injury, because they had no other way: asking that with his consent they might do this. Caesar, because he remembered that L. Cassius the consul had been slain and his army driven by the Helvetii and sent under the yoke, did not think it should be granted; nor did he think that men, with an enemy spirit, given the faculty of marching through the province, would refrain from injury and crime."

### EXP-012: [Catullus Poem 31.1-8]
**Latin Text:**
```
Paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque
ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis
marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus,
quam te libenter quamque laetus inviso,
vix mi ipse credens Thuniam atque Bithynos
liquisse campos et videre te in tuto.
O quid solutis est beatius curis,
cum mens onus reponit, ac peregrino
labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum,
desideratoque acquiescimus lecto?
Hoc est quod unum est pro laboribus tantis.
Salve, o venusta Sirmio, atque ero gaude
gaudente, vosque, o Lydiae lacus undae,
ridete quidquid est domi cachinnorum.

"Almost of islands, Sirmio, and of islands' little eye,
which so many as in liquid lakes
and the vast sea the two Neptunes carry,
how gladly and joyfully I see you,
hardly believing to myself that I have left
Thynia and the Bithynian fields and see you in safety.
O what is more blessed than care set aside,
when the mind lays down its burden, and having wearied
from foreign labor we come to our household god,
and we rest on the desired bed?
This is the one thing for such great labors.
Hail, lovely Sirmio, and be joyful with your lover
who is joyful, and you, o waves of the Lydian lake,
smile whatever there is of laughter at home."
