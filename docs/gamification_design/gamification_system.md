# Gamification System Blueprint for a Language Learning App

## Executive Summary and Objectives

This document specifies a comprehensive, evidence-based gamification system for a language learning application. The design aims to simultaneously elevate engagement, reinforce learning, and cultivate durable study habits through a cohesive set of mechanics: an experience points (XP) economy, a badge catalog with 20+ achievements, a humane streak system with multipliers and safeguards, an aligned level progression framework, weekly segmented leaderboards, a daily challenge program, and lightweight social features that encourage accountability withouttoxic competition. The system is crafted to balance intrinsic motivation (mastery, autonomy, relatedness) with extrinsic reinforcement (points, badges, status) to sustain long-term practice.

The expected outcomes are clear: higher daily and weekly active usage, improved lesson adherence, increased course completion, and broader learner exploration across languages and skill areas. Contemporary case studies of gamified language learning (notably Duolingo) show that points, streaks, badges, and leaderboards, when thoughtfully implemented, can materially improve retention and motivation—effects that inform this blueprint’s parameters and safeguards.[^1][^5]

At a high level, the design introduces:
- An XP economy with difficulty tiers, event multipliers, and caps to prevent exploitation.
- A badge taxonomy spanning foundational practice, streaks, grammar mastery, language-specific paths, cultural literacy, and social accountability—each with explicit unlock logic.
- A streak system with a protective Streak Freeze, tiered multipliers, milestone celebrations, and a recovery path that minimizes demotivation.
- A level structure that maps XP thresholds to thematic titles from “Novice Scholar” to “Master Philologist,” reinforcing progressive mastery rather than superficial grind.
- Weekly, segmented leaderboards with demotion/promotion rules, tie-breakers, anti-cheat controls, and opt-in visibility to preserve healthy competition.
- A daily challenge program offering thematic tasks and special rewards, including limited-time XP boosts and unique badges.
- Social features—friends, friend streaks, high-fives, and shareable milestones—plus privacy and anti-toxicity controls to strengthen community.

The implementation priorities follow a staged release path with early measurement of day-7/14/30 retention and A/B tests on streak leniency, freeze inventory, and leaderboard segmentation. A rigorous analytics and experimentation framework anchors iteration, while anti-cheat safeguards and fairness rules protect integrity.

## Design Principles and Evidence Base

The system is grounded in established learning theory, gamification research, and practical evidence from language apps. Three design pillars guide the architecture.

First, meaningful gamification should enhance, not replace, pedagogy. Points, badges, and levels serve as feedback and goal-setting scaffolds; they are not ends in themselves. Used judiciously, they can help learners parse progress, celebrate milestones, and maintain momentum, provided rewards are tied to learning value rather than grind.[^13][^16]

Second, streaks work because they leverage habit formation and loss aversion, but they must include humane safeguards. Habit formation benefits from consistent cues and small, repeatable actions that build automaticity. Loss aversion can motivate streak protection; however, without flexibility, a single miss can trigger demotivation. Leniency mechanisms—like streak freezes—can increase persistence by reducing the psychological penalty of occasional misses.[^2][^18][^19]

Third, leaderboards are potent but double-edged. Properly segmented cohorts, visible progress indicators, and fair rules can catalyze effort. Poorly designed leaderboards can discourage lower-ranked learners or create unhealthy pressure. Empirical work highlights the importance of cohort segmentation, demotion/promotion cadence, and transparency in tie-breakers and anti-cheat rules to sustain motivation across skill levels.[^8]

The following matrix maps each core mechanic to its primary psychological driver and intended learning behavior.

Table 1. Mechanic-to-psychology matrix

| Mechanic          | Primary Psychological Driver               | Intended Learning Behavior                                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| XP/Points         | Progress feedback; achievement              | Complete lessons across difficulty tiers; maintain varied practice |
| Badges            | Recognition; mastery signaling              | Explore new skills; deepen competence in focused areas             |
| Streaks           | Habit formation; loss aversion              | Practice daily; protect long-run consistency                       |
| Levels            | Competence progression; status              | Pursue cumulative mastery; sustain long-term engagement            |
| Leaderboards      | Social comparison; friendly competition     | Increase session frequency; compete within balanced cohorts        |
| Daily Challenges  | Novelty; goal setting; reward anticipation  | Engage with curated tasks; revisit weak areas                      |
| Social Features   | Accountability; belonging                   | Invite friends; send encouragement; share milestones               |

The literature on gamified learning consistently finds that points and badges can improve engagement when tightly coupled to meaningful tasks and feedback, that streaks increase daily adherence when designed with leniency, and that leaderboards increase effort when carefully segmented and governed.[^13][^16][^2][^8]

## XP/Points System: Difficulty Values, Multipliers, and Caps

The XP economy provides immediate, interpretable feedback on effort and mastery. Base XP per lesson reflects difficulty, and event multipliers add excitement without undermining the primary learning loop. Caps and cooldowns ensure fairness and reduce exploitation.

XP is earned for:
- Completing lessons across skill areas (e.g., vocabulary, grammar, reading, listening).
- Perfect or high-accuracy performances (accuracy bonuses).
- Challenge and event completions (time-boxed bonuses).
- Daily goal milestones (steady-state reinforcement).

Event multipliers apply to:
- Daily challenges (e.g., 1.5x XP for challenge completion).
- Limited-time thematic events (e.g., 1.25x XP during certain weeks).
- Streak milestones (e.g., 1.2x XP on the day of a streak milestone, such as day 7, 30, 100, 365).

Caps and anti-exploit:
- Daily soft cap: 500 XP. Above this threshold, XP is reduced by 50% until daily reset.
- Session cooldown: 5-minute cooldown after repeated attempts on the same item to curb farming.
- Duplicate detection: Reduced XP for repeated solves of identical items within a short time window; alternate item pools preferred for practice.
- Drift checks: Flag abnormal XP trajectories for review; investigate repeated, rapid top-ups across short sessions.

Table 2. Base XP per difficulty tier and recommended caps

| Tier         | Typical Task Examples                              | Base XP per Lesson | Daily Soft Cap | Notes                                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Beginner     | Basic vocabulary, simple phrases                    | 10                 | 500 XP         | Entry-level tasks to build momentum                           |
| Intermediate | Sentence transformation, dialog comprehension       | 20                 | 500 XP         | Core practice loop                                            |
| Advanced     | Complex reading, nuanced grammar, translation       | 30                 | 500 XP         | Emphasis on mastery                                           |
| Mastery      | Grammatical edge cases, literary analysis           | 40                 | 500 XP         | Limited daily volume recommended                              |
| Challenge    | Time-bound or high-stakes tasks                     | 50                 | 500 XP         | Bonus-eligible; event multipliers may apply                   |
| Review       | Spaced repetition items                             | 5–10               | 500 XP         | Low-friction reinforcement                                    |
| Cultural     | Context materials, reading with cultural notes      | 15–25              | 500 XP         | Encourages knowledge breadth                                  |

These values provide meaningful feedback while discouraging hollow repetition. Difficulty-tiered points reflect established guidance that points should signal accomplishment and be tied to meaningful tasks rather than time-on-task alone.[^13][^16]

### Difficulty Levels and XP Values

XP is calibrated to task difficulty, with accuracy modifiers rewarding quality. The goal is to promote both breadth and depth—encouraging learners to tackle harder tasks and to perfect foundational skills.

Table 3. Detailed XP mapping with accuracy modifiers

| Activity Type         | Difficulty Tier | Base XP | Accuracy Modifier                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Vocabulary            | Beginner        | 10      | 100%: +0; 80–99%: +0; <80%: +0                     |
| Vocabulary            | Intermediate    | 20      | 100%: +5; 90–99%: +3; 80–89%: +0; <80%: +0        |
| Grammar               | Beginner        | 10      | 100%: +5; 90–99%: +3; 80–89%: +0; <80%: +0        |
| Grammar               | Intermediate    | 20      | 100%: +10; 90–99%: +5; 80–89%: +0; <80%: +0       |
| Grammar               | Advanced        | 30      | 100%: +15; 90–99%: +7; 80–89%: +0; <80%: +0       |
| Grammar               | Mastery         | 40      | 100%: +20; 90–99%: +10; 80–89%: +0; <80%: +0      |
| Reading/Listening     | Intermediate    | 20      | 100%: +5; 90–99%: +3; 80–89%: +0; <80%: +0        |
| Reading/Listening     | Advanced        | 30      | 100%: +10; 90–99%: +5; 80–89%: +0; <80%: +0       |
| Cultural Materials    | Beginner        | 15      | 100%: +5; 90–99%: +3; 80–89%: +0; <80%: +0        |
| Challenge Tasks       | Challenge       | 50      | Time-bound bonus +10; perfect accuracy +10        |
| Review (Spaced Rep)   | Review          | 5–10    | No additional accuracy bonus to avoid farming     |

Modifiers are designed to encourage high-quality performance and reduce the incentive to rush through tasks. Time-bound challenge bonuses provide urgency and novelty without undermining the learning focus.[^16]

### Multipliers, Bonuses, and Anti-Exploit Rules

Multipliers are applied cautiously to preserve fairness and encourage healthy exploration.

- Streak multiplier tiers:
  - Days 1–6: 1.0x
  - Day 7: 1.1x
  - Days 8–29: 1.0x
  - Day 30: 1.2x
  - Days 31–99: 1.0x
  - Day 100: 1.3x
  - Days 101–364: 1.0x
  - Day 365: 1.5x
  - 365+: 1.1x per milestone day (e.g., +0.1x every additional 100 days)
- Event XP multipliers: up to 1.5x for daily challenges and time-limited thematic events.
- Accuracy multipliers: as specified in Table 3, rewarding perfect or near-perfect performance.
- Caps and anti-exploit: daily soft cap at 500 XP; session cooldowns on repeated items; duplicate detection; reduced XP for rapid re-solves; drift checks and manual review triggers.

Table 4. Event multipliers and safety rules

| Event Type                  | Multiplier    | Conditions                                 | Anti-Exploit Rules                                  |
|----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Daily Challenge            | 1.5x          | Complete assigned challenge set             | One challenge bonus per day                         |
| Themed Week Event          | 1.25x         | Participate during event window             | Cooldown applies; duplicate detection active        |
| Streak Milestone Day       | 1.1x–1.5x     | As per streak tier                          | Applies only to XP earned on milestone day          |
| Perfect Lesson             | +5 to +20     | 100% accuracy on applicable tiers           | No bonus on Review items                            |
| Time-Bound Challenge       | +10           | Complete within time limit                  | Server-side timer validation; repeat limit per day  |

These rules reflect established points design principles—using points as feedback mechanisms and avoiding reward schedules that overshadow learning objectives.[^16][^3]

## Streak System: Mechanics, Leniency, and Milestones

Streaks reinforce daily practice by making consistency visible and rewarding momentum without punishing unavoidable misses. The system tracks consecutive days of lesson completion, provides a Streak Freeze to protect progress, and includes special animations to celebrate milestones.

Day boundaries use the user’s local time zone. A day counts if at least one lesson is completed before midnight. Completing a lesson after midnight but before the next day’s reset counts for the new day.

Streak Freeze:
- Learners can hold up to two Freeze charges.
- Equipping a Freeze consumes a charge and protects the streak for one missed day.
- Freezes are earned through milestones (e.g., day 7) and periodic challenges; they can also be granted as leniency during special events.

Milestone multipliers:
- Day 7: 1.1x
- Day 30: 1.2x
- Day 100: 1.3x
- Day 365: 1.5x

Streak recovery:
- A optional “path back” mechanic allows learners to restore a broken streak via a short, focused challenge (e.g., three lessons in a row within 48 hours) without fully resetting the accumulated count. This encourages return to practice without trivializing the importance of daily effort.

The design draws on habit formation research (consistent cues and small wins build automaticity) and behavioral evidence that leniency increases persistence.[^2][^18][^19]

Table 5. Streak tiers, multipliers, and milestone rewards

| Streak Length | Multiplier on Milestone Day | Additional Rewards                            |
|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 7             | 1.1x                         | 1 Freeze charge; celebratory animation        |
| 30            | 1.2x                         | 1 Freeze charge; badge eligibility (see below)|
| 100           | 1.3x                         | 2 Freeze charges; unique badge                |
| 365           | 1.5x                         | 3 Freeze charges; unique badge                |
| 365+ (per 100)| +0.1x per milestone day      | Badge tier progression                        |

#### Milestones and Multipliers

Milestone days apply XP multipliers only to XP earned on that day, preserving fairness and focusing the incentive on celebration rather than acceleration. Celebratory animations appear upon extending a streak on milestone days; these lightweight visual cues can modestly increase near-term retention among newer learners while signaling mastery to veterans.[^2]

## Level Progression: Titles and Thresholds

Levels translate cumulative XP into meaningful status and pedagogical progression. Each level has a title and XP threshold, with practical benefits that support further learning (e.g., unlocking advanced challenges or optional cosmetic effects).

The progression framework is designed to reflect competence growth, not just time-on-platform. Titles provide identity and mastery signaling, and certain levels unlock advanced challenge lanes or specialized tracks without gating core content.

Table 6. Level progression titles and thresholds

| Level | Title                | Cumulative XP Threshold | Benefits/Signals                                         |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Novice Scholar       | 0                       | Access to beginner content; initial streak setup         |
| 2     | Focused Learner      | 300                     | Daily challenge unlock; badge visibility                 |
| 3     | Dedicated Student    | 900                     | Advanced grammar lane eligibility                        |
| 4     | Skilled Practitioner | 1,800                   | Leaderboard access; social features (friends)            |
| 5     | Adept Linguist       | 3,000                   | Challenge multiplier access (event weeks)                |
| 6     | Proficient Scholar   | 5,200                   | Cultural materials track unlock                          |
| 7     | Advanced Apprentice  | 8,000                   | Weekly league promotion eligibility                      |
| 8     | Master Builder       | 12,000                  | Unique badge eligibility tiers                           |
| 9     | Expert Grammarian    | 18,000                  | Grammar Mastery challenges unlock                        |
| 10    | Master Philologist   | 26,000+                 | Highest-tier challenges; special event leadership roles  |

XP thresholds are cumulative and require a broad mix of activities to reach, preventing narrow optimization. Level titles and benefits are aligned to reinforcement principles: they recognize accomplishment while opening opportunities for further mastery.[^13][^16]

## Badge/Achievement System (20+ Badges)

Badges recognize specific achievements, encourage exploration across skill domains, and create visible mastery signals. The system balances breadth (coverage across languages and skills) with depth (mastery within targeted areas) and includes social and challenge-driven accomplishments.

Badge categories:
- Foundational Practice: entry-level volume and consistency.
- Streaks: length milestones and resilience (freeze utilization).
- Grammar Mastery: targeted grammar achievements.
- Language-Specific: Latin and Greek themed progression.
- Cultural Literacy: reading and contextual knowledge.
- Social & Challenge: daily challenges, event participation, and social accountability.

#### Category Coverage and Rationale

The badge set is distributed to reinforce core behaviors:
- Foundational practice encourages initial momentum and broad exploration across languages and skills.
- Streak badges cement habit formation, with Freeze-related recognition to promote strategic use of leniency.
- Grammar mastery badges provide depth signals and incentivize focused practice on challenging topics.
- Language-specific badges offer thematic progression aligned to Latin and Greek tracks, supporting identity and sustained interest.
- Cultural literacy badges promote contextual knowledge, ensuring learners engage with materials beyond isolated drills.
- Social and challenge badges reward participation in weekly competitions, events, and friend networks, strengthening accountability.

Badge impacts on motivation and referrals are well-documented; public recognition and shareability can boost engagement and social growth when implemented thoughtfully.[^1][^5]

## Leaderboard Mechanics and Social Features

Leaderboards are structured as weekly, XP-gated leagues with clear promotion and demotion rules. Cohorts are segmented by skill level to reduce discouragement and create fairer competition. Visibility is opt-in, and social features emphasize support rather than pressure.

Weekly leagues:
- Bronze (0–199 XP previous week)
- Silver (200–499 XP previous week)
- Gold (500–799 XP previous week)
- Emerald (800–1,199 XP previous week)
- Sapphire (1,200+ XP previous week)

Promotion/demotion:
- Top 10% in a league (minimum XP threshold applies) are promoted.
- Bottom 10% are demoted (unless protected by a minimum threshold).
- Mid 80% remain in the same league.

Tie-breakers:
1. Higher total XP for the week
2. Fewer session attempts (efficiency tie-break)
3. Higher accuracy rate across the week
4. Earlier completion time within the week

Anti-cheat:
- Duplicate item limits; XP reductions on rapid re-solves.
- Drift checks for anomalous XP gains.
- Manual review flags for suspicious patterns.

Social features:
- Friends list with high-fives and motivational prompts.
- Friend streaks and challenges (e.g., matched daily goals).
- Opt-in visibility and privacy controls; mute/block features to prevent harassment.

Table 8. Weekly leaderboard tiers, thresholds, and rules

| Tier     | Promotion Threshold                | Demotion Rule                      | Visibility          |
|----------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Bronze   | Top 10% OR ≥200 XP                 | Bottom 10% OR <50 XP               | Opt-in; private by default |
| Silver   | Top 10% OR ≥500 XP                 | Bottom 10% OR <150 XP              | Opt-in; private by default |
| Gold     | Top 10% OR ≥800 XP                 | Bottom 10% OR <300 XP              | Opt-in; private by default |
| Emerald  | Top 10% OR ≥1,200 XP               | Bottom 10% OR <450 XP              | Opt-in; private by default |
| Sapphire | Maintain top 10% with ≥1,200 XP    | Bottom 10% OR <600 XP              | Opt-in; private by default |

These cohort and tie-break designs follow evidence-based guidance for leaderboard effectiveness: segmentation, transparent criteria, and safeguards mitigate the downsides of social comparison and maintain motivation.[^8][^1][^5]

|------------------|-----------------|---------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Vocabulary Sprint| Beginner–Adv.   | 50      | 1.5x       | Badge eligibility after 10 completions|
| Grammar Gauntlet | Inter.–Mastery  | 50      | 1.5x       | Grammar badge progress                 |
| Listening Lab    | Inter.–Adv.     | 50      | 1.5x       | —                                     |
| Reading Relay    | Inter.–Adv.     | 50      | 1.5x       | Cultural badge progress                |
| Translation Trial| Adv.–Mastery    | 50      | 1.5x       | —                                     |
| Speech Spotlight | Inter.–Adv.     | 50      | 1.5x       | —                                     |
| Cultural Capsule | Beginner–Inter. | 50      | 1.5x       | Unique event badge                     |

Event variants introduce novel constraints (e.g., time-limited tasks with themed narratives) to keep the experience fresh and encourage continued participation.[^5]

## Progression Alignment Across Mechanics

Alignment ensures that XP, levels, badges, streaks, leaderboards, and challenges reinforce one another rather than compete. Each mechanic maps to specific learning outcomes and to system KPIs.

Table 10. Cross-mechanic alignment map

| Mechanic     | Learning Outcome                              | System KPI                        | Reinforcement Pattern                          |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| XP           | Skill practice across difficulty tiers        | DAU, lesson completions           | Points for meaningful tasks; accuracy bonuses |
| Levels       | Cumulative mastery signaling                  | Weekly active users               | Thresholds tied to broad activity mix         |
| Badges       | Focused mastery recognition                   | Badge views, shares, referrals    | Public signals; social sharing                |
| Streaks      | Daily habit formation                         | Day-7/14/30 retention             | Milestones; Freeze leniency                   |
| Leaderboards | Social accountability and effort              | Weekly engagement                 | Weekly cohorts; promotion/demotion            |
| Challenges   | Targeted practice and novelty                 | Challenge participation           | Rotations; multipliers; event badges          |

This alignment follows best practices: rewards should support learning, not overshadow it; points provide feedback, badges recognize achievement, and social mechanics amplify accountability without coercion.[^13][^16]

## Implementation Guidelines and Measurement

Implementation should proceed in stages, with early measurement focused on habit formation and engagement, and ongoing A/B tests to calibrate multipliers, caps, and segmentation.

Core instrumentation:
- Daily/weekly XP earned; distribution across tiers.
- Streak length distribution; Freeze usage; recovery rates.
- Challenge participation; completion rates; reward claims.
- Leaderboard movement; promotion/demotion; tie-break outcomes.
- Badge unlocks; shares; referral impacts.

A/B testing priorities:
- Streak Freeze inventory: 1 vs. 2 charges; evaluate persistence and demotivation.
- Milestone multiplier magnitudes: measure engagement uplift vs. grinding behavior.
- Leaderboard segmentation: XP-gated vs. skill-level cohorts; assess motivation and churn.
- Daily challenge multipliers: 1.3x vs. 1.5x; measure participation and retention.
- XP caps: 400 vs. 500; evaluate balance of engagement vs. exploit risk.

Table 11. Experiment matrix

| Hypothesis                                   | Variants                         | Primary Metrics                    | Guardrails                              |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| More Freeze charges increase persistence      | 1 vs. 2 charges                  | Day-14 retention; streak length    | No increase in demotivation indicators  |
| Higher milestone multipliers boost engagement| 1.1x/1.2x/1.3x/1.5x calibration | DAU; XP/day; challenge participation | No spike in farming behaviors           |
| Skill-based leaderboards reduce discouragement| XP-gated vs. skill-segmented     | Weekly engagement; churn           | Maintain social accountability signals  |
| Higher challenge multipliers increase participation| 1.3x vs. 1.5x                  | Challenge completion rate          | Quality of practice (accuracy) stable   |
| Lower daily XP cap reduces farming           | 400 vs. 500                      | XP/day distribution; exploit flags | Stable retention metrics                |

Telemetry and privacy:
- Track XP earn events with timestamps and session identifiers.
- Audit duplicate solves and rapid re-solves; flag anomalies.
- Aggregate streak analytics; store Freeze usage securely.
- Weekly leaderboard logs with tie-break details.
- Ensure opt-in visibility and GDPR/CCPA-compliant data handling.

## Risks, Anti-Cheat, and Fairness

Three risks require active management: farming (repeat solving to inflate XP), leaderboard discouragement (demotivation among lower-ranked learners), and privacy concerns (oversharing or harassment). The system employs caps, cooldowns, segmentation, and opt-in controls to mitigate these risks.

Table 12. Risk-to-mitigation mapping

| Risk                     | Mitigation                                         | Monitoring                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| XP farming              | Daily caps; session cooldowns; duplicate detection  | Rapid re-solve rate; XP distribution drift  |
| Leaderboard discouragement| Skill-segmented leagues; opt-in visibility        | Churn in lower ranks; participation rates   |
| Privacy concerns        | Opt-in sharing; mute/block; friend requests controls| Reports; moderation logs                    |
| Badge inflation         | Tiered conditions; perfect/advanced accuracy checks| Badge unlock distribution; share rates      |
| Streak demotivation     | Freeze charges; recovery path; milestone celebrations| Streak break rate; Freeze usage             |

Fairness and integrity are central to maintaining trust; governance of ties, promotion/demotion, and anti-cheat rules should be transparent and consistently enforced.[^8][^13]

### Appendix B: Glossary

- Experience Points (XP): Numeric feedback awarded for learning activities; accumulates toward levels.
- Streak: Consecutive days of lesson completion; includes milestone multipliers and Freeze protections.
- Freeze: Protective item that preserves a streak for one missed day.
- Daily Challenge: Thematic, rotating tasks with special rewards.
- Leaderboard Tier: Weekly cohort with promotion/demotion rules based on prior week XP.
- Badge: Recognition signal for specific achievements; may have tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold).

### Appendix C: Mathematical Formulas

- Daily XP calculation:
  - XP_earned = Σ [Base_XP(activity) × Accuracy_Modifier + Event_Multiplier × (Base_XP + Accuracy_Bonus)]
  - After daily soft cap: XP_above_cap reduced by 50%
- Streak multiplier application:
  - Multiplier applies only on milestone days to XP earned that day
- Level threshold mapping:
  - Level_n unlocks when cumulative_XP ≥ threshold_n
  - Benefits unlock at level thresholds (see Table 6)
- Leaderboard ties:
  - Tie-breaker order: weekly XP → fewer attempts → higher accuracy → earlier completion time

## Information Gaps and Assumptions

The system requires decisions on several product details:
- Supported languages and tracks (beyond Latin/Greek exemplars) and content taxonomy.
- Lesson types (e.g., multiple-choice, typing, speaking, listening) and item schemas.
- Daily session length targets and typical time-on-task.
- Platform constraints (mobile/web), push notification capabilities, and onboarding flows.
- Age demographics and privacy requirements (e.g., COPPA, GDPR).
- Monetization strategy (premium, in-app currency, advertisements) and reward budgeting.
- Accessibility goals (color contrast, screen-reader support, dyslexic-friendly fonts) and localization scope.

These choices influence XP calibration, badge unlock logic, challenge rotation, and privacy controls; they should be finalized before launch to ensure coherent parameterization and compliance.
